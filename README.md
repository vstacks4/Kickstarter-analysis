# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of the Project 
The project allowed for the analysis of theater campaign outcomes based on launch date and funding goals utilizing the provided *Kickstarter Data* provided. The project also allowed for application of excel tools to draw conclusions about the data.
### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis was to determine if the launch date or funding goals had an impact on the outcome of Theater. The project allowed for the utilization of excel for both analysis and visualization.
## Analysis and Challenges:
I performed the entire analysis utilizing Excel analysis functunality and visualization tools; such as pivot tables, graphing, charting etc. One challenged I faced with this
project was ensuring that I was careful and copied all the relevant data. It is easy to miss a line of data that can completely change your results. This happened once and I had
to return to the *Kickstarter dataset* and redo the statistical analysis.  Lastly, this project helped to *refresh* my excel skills which I haven't had to use at this level for
many years. The lack of the most "up to date" excel skills can be challenging during the analyze phase of the project. To overcome this challenge, I took time in completing the
project and reviewed the assignment notes and videos as necessary.  

## Results:
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date:
The first observation that can be determined from the data is that May is a very successful month for a theater launch.  The data shows that the number of successful launches was higher in May than any other month. Additionally, May had the highest percentage of successful campaigns (as a percentage of monthly launch campaigns). In general, May, June and July are the best launch months. These three months had both higher number of campaigns launched and the highest overall success rate. Secondly, the launch data clearly demonstrates that December is not a good month to launch. December not only had the lowest number of launched campaigns but also the highest failed percentage of any other month.
					
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals:
Goals of less than $1000 is positively correlated with higher success rates. Additionally the success rate continued to decline and fail rates continually increased as the goal level increased. Once the goal level reached $30,000 the data showed an gradual increase in the success rate until $45,000 and there is a precipitous decline in the success rate of the campaigns.
### Limitations of the Data Set:
One of the limitations of the data is that we didn't have any background to determine the reason for the launch dates or how goals were established. Additionally, there is no context for how this data compares to the "universe" of similar campaigns. Are the outcomes and goals similar to other campaigns of similar size and scope---are they realistic? There is some additional analysis that could have been performed on the dataset. One analysis is to determine the influence of the year of launch has on the dataset. Where some years more succesful than others and that influence the overall outcome. 
### Other Possible Table and Graphs
There are number of additional table and graphs that can be used to analyze the data.  One table additional table I used was the success rate by launch month. Using this table I was able to determine which month. A regression analysis could also be completed to determine the impact of the the independent variables had on the dependent variable of outcomes. A scatter plot then could be useful.
